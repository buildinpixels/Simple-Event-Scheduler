# Simple-Event-Scheduler
A state-driven event scheduler built with pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Features include async data loading, event creation, sorting and filtering, automatic conflict detection and resolution, and real-time derived statistics—all implemented without frameworks to demonstrate core frontend logic and architecture.

✨ Features

Asynchronous event loading (simulated API)
Centralized immutable application state
Dynamic event rendering using map, filter, and reduce
Sorting events by start time, duration, or title
Filtering by online/offline, long events, and conflicts
Automatic conflict detection for overlapping events
One-click conflict resolution by adjusting event timings
Real-time dashboard statistics (derived, not stored)
Create new events via form input
Clean, responsive, enterprise-style UI

🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated
State-driven rendering (single source of truth)
Immutable state updates
Derived data instead of duplicated state
Pure helper functions for business logic
Separation of concerns (logic vs UI)
Time comparison and scheduling logic

🛠 Tech Stack
HTML5
CSS3 (custom, no frameworks)
Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
No libraries. No frameworks. No build tools.

📌 Why This Project
This project was built to practice and demonstrate real-world frontend problem-solving without relying on abstractions.
It reflects patterns used internally by frameworks like React—implemented manually to deepen understanding of how state, rendering, and logic interact.
